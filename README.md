# portfoliowebsite

Why did I make this portfolio website?
I made this portfolio page because I wanted to realize a custom project using code language. I made this choice because I had no experience in this and I wanted to challenge myself to improve myself and gain more knowledge. Maybe in the future I would like to work as a freelancer for web design/development, this first project will contribute a lot to my development.

I made the choice for a portfolio page because I wanted to realize something that I could also use after this Advanced Course. A portfolio page is of course your business card and also contributes to your own professionalism. It is the first thing a potential client or agency can see of you and based on your portfolio they will make a choice to work with you. In short: A portfolio is always useful for my career and is therefore useful for the long term.


How do people use it?
People use my portfolio page as a first impression of myself and my services and qualities. All my projects are visible and clients know who they might be dealing with. They can scroll through every element and focus on the parts that interests them. My website is a one page including a toggler menu and back-to-top button for quick navigation. 


What would a next version include?
This project is not completely finished yet. A next version would contain: More of my projects and a clickthrough to a separate window where the specific projects will be explained. This would allow the client or agency to get a better idea of what this project contains and what exactly my tasks were in this project. I would also have to take a closer look at the link pages of my social media icons and the contact form. For the final version I would of course change my dummy texts to personal texts with good copywriting.
